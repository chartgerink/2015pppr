# Post-publication peer review

This project investigates a subselection of psychology papers and engages in a post-publication peer review (PPPR) in order to learn some lessons on the reporting of statistical results. 

Original, unanonymized data from running statcheck are not included due to ethics board restrictions. The anonymized results *are* included and unanonymized results of extracted results per paper are also included.

To-do:

- [x] Create dataset of statcheck results 
- [x] Count number of statcheck results per paper
- [ ] X step procedure per paper
- [ ] Random paper selection from statcheck data
